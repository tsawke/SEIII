## Dialogue

Story happened after the day Stanley found the fossil.

- Stanley: Morning here seems to be so early. Feels like the sun is burning.
- X-Ray: Whatever, don't be late, noob.
- Stanley: I’m trying, alright. My hands are almost not working.
- Zero: Just hold the handle lower. That will make you feel easier.
- Stanley: Thanks. Yesterday I found a little fossil, but it didn’t count.
- X-Ray: Interesting things will count. Pass it to me!
- Stanley: It didn't count, why does that help?
- X-Ray: Cuz for me I cam get I day off. 
- Mr. Sir: Move it, now! Or I'll kick your ass.
- X-Ray: And if you wish a shade when you need it, remember do it faster.
