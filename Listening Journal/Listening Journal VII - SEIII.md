## Summary

This video explains the continuous rising tension between the United States and Venezuela. It showcased the message that posted on social media by President Trump, which says airlines and pilots should treat Venezuelan airspace as 'closed in its entirety'. This signal also represents a higher pressure on President Nicolás Maduro. And the video clarifies the multiple risks: miscalculation, legal limits, regional fallout, etc.

## Reflection

I chose this video since it's extremely interesting and attractive. It explained what to wear, when to drive, even how to breathe in this strict environment in detail. And seeing breath becoming glittering crystals made the science reachable. Plus, I obtained that in that place, the  official lowest temperature record is −67.7°C and the unofficial is -71°C. The totally different living style really astonished me, that we shall never underestimate the power of nature.
