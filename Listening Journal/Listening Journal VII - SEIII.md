I chose this video since it's extremely interesting and attractive. It explained what to wear, when to drive, even how to breathe in this strict environment in detail. And seeing breath becoming glittering crystals made the science reachable. Plus, I obtained that in that place, the  official lowest temperature record is −67.7°C and the unofficial is -71°C. The totally different living style really astonished me, that we shall never underestimate the power of nature.
